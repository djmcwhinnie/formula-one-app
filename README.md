# Formula One App

## Description

### What is this site?

This is a minimalist, clean dashboard where you can see some of the main result data from the last Formula 1 Grand Prix race as well as a countdown to get ready for the next. There is also a race schedule calendar to see when and where all of the races are for this year's championship.

### Why did I make this site?

Practice. Improving my JavaScript skills by building something around an interest has been very different compared to doing online tutorials or other methods for learning. Building something from the ground up allowed me to problem solve so much more as I worked between what the API data gave me, what I wanted to do with it, and how I wanted it to look.

## TODO

As a MVP version of the site idea I had in mind when I set out to create something using the available F1 race data, there are a number of elements and areas that I would like to revisit at a later time to alter, improve, add and refactor in the future.

-   Refactor
    -   Reduce some of the repeated logic where possible and move to a more DRY code approach.
-   Race Results
    -   Add more facts, figures and data available from the last race.
-   Race Countdown
    -   Add more features and content to the race countdown, including sprint race information and qualifying information.
-   Calendar
    -   Visually update the race schedule cards on the calendar page of the site to highlight races past compared to races still to come.
    -   Replace generic track icons with an icon of the actual circuit for the Grand Prix round.

## Resources

The main resource behind the site is the (unofficial) Formula 1 API web service [Ergast](http://ergast.com/mrd/). I came across the API via a collective list of free open API resources while looking for some inspiration for a side project.

While laying out the design for the site I needed quick access to some icons to help flesh out sections. I turned to flaticon for this and the attribution links for icons used in the design can be found below:
